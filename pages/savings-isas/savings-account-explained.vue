              </div>
              <p class="text-subtitle-2 text-sm-subtitle-1 font-weight-light">
                Savings accounts provide a place for you to put your money aside. You’d use these accounts to help you save up for when you need it. They aren't meant to be used for day-to-day spending.
              </p>
              <p class="text-subtitle-2 text-sm-subtitle-1 font-weight-light">
                There are many types of savings accounts, with different rates and terms. You'll earn money on your savings based on your account's interest rate.

              Types of savings accounts

                        <p class="font-weight-bold ma-0 pa-0">Instant-access savings accounts</p>
                        You can pay in and take out money whenever you need to.
                    </li>
                    <li class="text-subtitle-2 text-sm-subtitle-1 font-weight-light ma-0 py-3">
                        <p class="font-weight-bold ma-0 pa-0">Limited-access savings accounts</p>
                        Often offering a better interest rate than an instant-access account. The difference is that you'll be limited to a certain number of withdrawals in each account year to keep that interest rate.
                    </li>
                    <li class="text-subtitle-2 text-sm-subtitle-1 font-weight-light ma-0 py-3   ">
                        <p class="font-weight-bold ma-0 pa-0">Fixed-rate savings accounts</p>
                        A way to save a lump sum for a fixed amount of time. Your interest rate is fixed, so it won't go up or down. For some fixed rate accounts, you can’t take out your money before the term ends. For others, it's not possible to take out money without paying an early-access charge..

                    What you're saving for can affect the account you choose. Some savings accounts we offer are designed for a specific purpose.

                The difference between an ISA and other savings accounts
                </div>
                <p class="text-subtitle-2 text-sm-subtitle-1 font-weight-light">
                    A cash ISA is a type of savings account where the interest you earn is tax-free. So you could get more for your money. 
                </p>
                 <p class="text-subtitle-2 text-sm-subtitle-1 font-weight-light">
                    The amount you can put in an ISA is set by your ISA allowance. This is the most you can save in an ISA in each tax year. For 2022/23, the allowance is £20,000.
              </p>
              <p class="text-subtitle-2 text-sm-subtitle-1 font-weight-light">
                Like other savings accounts, cash ISAs can also offer different options for accessing your money. These can include: limited access and fixed rate cash ISAs. 
              </p>

            </div>
            <p class="text-subtitle-2 text-sm-subtitle-1 font-weight-light">
                Regular savings accounts are specific accounts that can help you get into the savings habit. They usually come with limits on how much money you can put into your account each month.
              </p>

                You can't use our personal savings accounts if you want to save for your business. Instead, our business savings accounts can help you make the most out of your organisation’s cash reserves.

              Paying tax on your savings
              </div>
              <p class="text-subtitle-2 text-sm-subtitle-1 font-weight-light">
                When you save, you may have to pay tax on the interest you earn on your savings.
              </p>
              <p class="text-subtitle-2 text-sm-subtitle-1 font-weight-light">
                As a saver you have what's called a Personal Savings Allowance (PSA). Your PSA is the most you can earn in interest on your savings before you're taxed.
              </p>
              <p class="text-subtitle-2 text-sm-subtitle-1 font-weight-light">
                How much your PSA is depends on the rate of income tax you pay. For example, basic rate taxpayers can earn up to £1,000 in tax-free interest each year
